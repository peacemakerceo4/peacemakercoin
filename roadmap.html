                <p class="roadmap-subtitle">This is a time‑sensitive launch. Our roadmap is designed to capture momentum quickly, fund <strong>$1M</strong> in impact, and empower Palestinian people and future institutions consistent with a Two‑State horizon.</p>

                    <h3>Our Position</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe renewed diplomatic leadership — including U.S. engagement that has featured President Trump alongside Israeli leadership — can help unlock a viable peace track. 
                        Our mission is clear: <strong>support Palestinians</strong> through transparent, humanitarian‑first funding while advocating a <strong>workable Two‑State framework</strong>. 
                        We are launching now because timing and attention matter; our community aims to reach <strong>$1M quickly</strong> to turn momentum into measurable relief.

                            <p>
                                Following high‑level talks between U.S. and Israeli leadership, international focus intensified on de‑escalation and a negotiated horizon. 
                                Our thesis: <strong>renewed Trump‑led engagement could catalyze progress toward a durable peace</strong>. In parallel, <strong>Peacemaker Coin</strong> channels support toward Palestinian communities and initiatives consistent with a <strong>Two‑State Solution</strong>.
